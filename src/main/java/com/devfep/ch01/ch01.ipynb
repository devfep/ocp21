    "- static: this keyword makes the method a class method and not an instance method. This means that we do not need to create an object(instance) of the class before we can use the method. The keyword binds the method to the class name and it is readily available for use by just calling Zoo.main()\n",
    "- void: the main method return nothing(no data). Methods that change object states usually have void return types and silently return control to the caller of the method\n",
    "- String[] args: the main method parameter accepts an array([]) of String objects. The identifier of the array is set to `args` by convention but can be anything like foobar\n",
    "  - Other ways of indicating an array of String objects include `String foobar[]`, `String... foobar`\n",

    "      - It must be the last param in the method signature if it happens not to be the only parameter\n",

    "    - What then is the difference between `[]` and `...`?\n",
    "      - varargs simplifies method calls\n",
    "        - no need to create an array to pass it as an argument. You can just type the members of the array right in the method and it will be handled as an array\n",
    "        - varargs also allow your method to be called with no args rather than passing in an identifier of an empty array.\n",
