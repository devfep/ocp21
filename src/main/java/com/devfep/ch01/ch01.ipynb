The keyword binds the method to the class name and it is readily available for use by just calling Zoo.main()\n",
    "- void: the main method return nothing(no data). Methods that change object states usually have void return types and silently return control to the caller of the method\n",
    "- String[] args: the main method parameter accepts an array([]) of String objects. The identifier of the array is set to `args` by convention but can be anything like foobar\n",
    "  - Other ways of indicating an array of String objects include `String foobar[]`, `String... foobar`\n",

    "\n",
    "- Packages are logical groupings for classes\n",
    "- Import statements(instructions) tell the compiler which package to look in to find a class\n",

    "#### Wildcards\n",
    "- Classes in the same package are often imported together\n",
    "  - In such a case, you can use the wildcard (*) shortcut to import all classes in the said package\n",
    "  ```java\n",
    "    import java.util.* //imports java.util.Random among other classes\n",
    "\n",
    "    public class NumberPicker {\n",
    "      Random r = new Random();\n",
    "      system.out.println(r.nextInt(10));\n",
    "    }\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The wildcard does not bring in child packages, fields, or methods. It only imports direct classes under the package specified\n",
    "- Wildcard imports do not slow down your application since the compiler optimizes imports and knows exactly what to bring in\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Redundant Imports\n",
    "- Classes in the java.lang package do not need to be explicitly imported since it automatically imported\n",
    "- Another redundant import could be writing an import statement for a class that is in the same package as where the import is happening\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Naming Conflicts\n",
    "- When using classes that happen to have the same name but from different packages, the compiler would want some explicit imports to be made so as to not get confused\n",
    "  - The Date class can be found in the `java.util.*` package and `java.sql.*` package\n",
    "  - Importing both packages using the wildcard format to use the Date class in the source code will result in a compilation error\n",
    "  - If the Date class intended to be used is the util one, we can remove the sql import.\n",
    "  - But what if we intend to use other classes in the sql package?\n",
    "    - In this case we can make an explicit import `java.util.Date` which will take precedence over the wildcard import and the compiler would know that the Date class referenced in the source code is the one in the util package\n",
    "  - What then do we do if we want to use the Date class in both packages?\n",
    "    - If we do `java.util.Date` and `java.sql.Date`, it is no different than the wildcard import since the compiler wouldn't know which package's Date we're referring to in the source code.\n",
    "    - You can just import one of the packages and use the other's **fully qualified class name** in the source code eg. `java.util.Date Date;` or you can drop both imports and always use the fully qualified class names for both\n",
